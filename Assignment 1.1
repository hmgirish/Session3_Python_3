1.1 Write a Python Program to implement your own myreduce() function which works exactly
like Python's built-in function reduce()

Solution:

Without using reduce function:

data = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
product = 1
for x in data:
    product = product * x
    
product

Using reduce function:

from functools import reduce
data = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
product = lambda x, y: x*y
reduce (product, data)
